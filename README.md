# time-for-windows

A command to stats program running time on Windows.

I named it `timew.exe` to make it diffrent from Windows' `time.exe`, means time-for-windows.

## Usage

```
timew.exe <yourprogram>
```

example:

```
C:\Users\mazhuang\Desktop>timew a.exe
1 3 12 0 0
a.exe finished
cost time: 6ms
```
